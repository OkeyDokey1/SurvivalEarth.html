		<h1>Intro to Survival Earth</h1>
    	<h2>How to play</h2>
     <p>In this game, you start with a small wooden house, some food, some water, and lots of tools (pickaxes, axes, shovels, anvils, swords, etc). You need to get food and water to survive, but the weather outside is horrible, and you may get shot by a lightning bolt once you go out, or get flooded by the waves. However, you are very good at science and technology, so once you have enough materials, you can start making the weather better, or even programme AIs to help yourself. Later the game, you build better houses, hire workers, and even go to the moon. You win the game by building a colony on the moon.</p>
